Not a Mouse stirring Barn . Well , goodnight . If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus , the Riuals of my Watch , bid them make hast . Enter Horatio and Marcellus . Fran . I thinke I heare them . Stand : who ' s there ? Hor . Friends to this ground Mar . And Leige - men to the Dane Fran . Giue you good night Mar . O farwel honest Soldier , who hath relieu ' d you ? Fra . Barnardo ha ' s my place : giue you goodnight . Exit Fran . Mar . Holla Barnardo Bar . Say , what is Horatio there ? Hor . A peece of him Bar . Welcome Horatio , welcome good Marcellus Mar .

Horatio saies , ' tis but our Fantasie , And will not let beleefe take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight , twice seene of vs , Therefore I haue intreated him along With vs , to watch the minutes of this Night , That if againe this Apparition come , He may approue our eyes , and speake to it Hor . Tush , tush , ' twill not appeare Bar . Sit downe a - while , And let vs once againe assaile your eares , That are so fortified against our Story , What we two Nights haue seene Hor . Well , sit we downe , And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this Barn .

Peace , breake thee of : Enter the Ghost . Looke where it comes againe Barn . In the same figure , like the King that ' s dead Mar . Thou art a Scholler ; speake to it Horatio Barn . Lookes it not like the King ? Marke it Horatio Hora . Most like : It harrowes me with fear & wonder Barn . It would be spoke too Mar . Question it Horatio Hor . What art thou that vsurp ' st this time of night , Together with that Faire and Warlike forme In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke Did sometimes march : By Heauen I charge thee speake Mar . It is offended Barn . See , it stalkes away Hor . Stay : speake ; speake : I Charge thee , speake . Exit the Ghost . Mar . ' Tis gone , and will not answer Barn . How now Horatio ? You tremble & look pale : Is not this something more then Fantasie ? What thinke you on ' t ? Hor . Before my God , I might not this beleeue Without the sensible and true auouch Of mine owne eyes Mar . Is it not like the King ? Hor . As thou art to thy selfe , Such was the very Armour he had on , When th ' Ambitious Norwey combatted : So frown ' d he once , when in an angry parle He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice .
